# Securing Spring Boot APIs and SPAs with OAuth 2.0

In this article, you will learn how to create and secure a [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) SPA and a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) API using [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/). You will start by scaffolding a new Spring Boot project. Then you will add some endpoints to it. After that, you will use Spring Security to secure the whole thing. Lastly, you will create a SPA (with jQuery) to consume the API. If needed, you can find the reference code developed throughout the article in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0-blog/spring-boot-oauth2).
